# Noob JSON Parser - C++ Version of Lept JSON Parser

## Introduction

The Lept JSON is a simple JSON parser & generator introduced by [@Milo Yip](https://github.com/miloyip) in his tutorial [从零开始的 JSON 库教程](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22457315).

The original version is programmed in C, I rewrote the whole program using C++ while reading the tutorial. After I finished the first version, I realized that it was imperfect, mixed C and C++ style and full of bugs.

The **Noob JSON Parser** is the refactor of the first version, aiming to make it more concise and robust. The name "Noob" means that the coder, which is myself, is totally a rookie in coding, not the parser.

Finally I want to express my thanks to [@Milo Yip](https://github.com/miloyip), who writes such a good tutorial from which I learn so much.
